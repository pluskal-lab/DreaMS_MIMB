# DreaMS_MIMB

TODO this text redo

A step-by-step tutorial and reproducible environment for working with the DreaMS large foundation model for mass spectrometry.  
This project guides you through the full workflow—from data preparation, through model fine-tuning, to advanced investigation—with annotated Jupyter Notebooks, explained for absolute beginners.

---

## 🚀 What is DreaMS_MIMB?

- **DreaMS_MIMB** is a collection of logical, stepwise tutorials (Jupyter Notebooks) to teach you:
  - How to prepare mass spectrometry data
  - Deduplicate and match spectral libraries
  - Train and fine-tune the DreaMS model for your own data
  - Investigate and interpret predictions

**No prior experience with machine learning or mass spectrometry required!**

## 🛠️ Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:
- **Anaconda / Miniconda installed**  
  (Recommended: Miniconda for minimal install; both Windows, Mac, and Linux are supported.)
- **Conda** is a tool that helps you install all the software and libraries needed for this project with a single command, and keeps them separated from other programs on your computer.

If you don’t have Conda yet:
1. Download Miniconda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Follow the official install instructions for your operating system  


**How to check if Conda is installed**

Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt on Windows) and type:

```bash
conda --version
```

If you see a version number (like `conda 23.3.1`), you’re ready!  
If you see an error, install Miniconda first.

---

## 📦 Step 2: Get the code

1. Open your terminal  
   - On Windows: Open the Anaconda Prompt from the Start Menu (search for “Anaconda Prompt” and click it).  
     **TODO:** Add screenshot of opening Anaconda Prompt  
   - On macOS/Linux: Open your Terminal application from the Applications folder or system menu.
2. Navigate to the folder where you want this project. For example, to use your Documents folder:

    ```bash
    cd Documents
    ```

3. Download (clone) the project code from GitHub:

    Type these commands in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jozefov/DreaMS_MIMB.git
    cd DreaMS_MIMB
    ```
   This downloads all the files and code you will need for the tutorial into a folder called DreaMS_MIMB.
   
	(You only need to do this once. You’ll always run everything from inside this folder.)

### 💡 **If you don’t have Git installed**

You can get the code just as easily! This method does the same thing as the `git clone` command, just with a few extra clicks.

1. Go to the project’s GitHub page:  
   [https://github.com/Jozefov/DreaMS_MIMB](https://github.com/Jozefov/DreaMS_MIMB)

2. Click the green **“Code”** button, then click **“Download ZIP”**.

3. Unzip (extract) the folder to the location you want on your computer
   - for example, your **Documents** folder.  
      This will create a folder named `DreaMS_MIMB` containing all the code and resources you need.

4. Open your terminal, and *change directory* (terminal command `cd`) into that folder.  
   If you put it in Documents:

    ```bash
    cd DreaMS_MIMB
    ```

   *(If your folder is in a different place, use that path instead.)*

---

**What’s happening in this step?**  
You are simply downloading all the resources and code needed for this tutorial – like getting all the pieces of a board game out of the box.  
*Don’t worry – using the ZIP file is just as good as using Git!*

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Setup Your Environment (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Confirm Conda is working**

```bash
conda --version
```

If you see the version number, proceed! If not, see Step 1.

1. **Create the Conda Environment**  
   This ensures all dependencies work on your system:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

2. **Activate the Environment**

    ```bash
    conda activate dreams_mimb
    ```
TODO explain here what is going on here a little. Why we need activate something

If you see errors about “conda command not found,” make sure you have Conda installed and restart your terminal.

## 📓 Step 4: Start Jupyter Notebooks

You must use Jupyter Notebooks to run this project!  
Jupyter Notebooks allow you to run code interactively, step by step, and see immediate results.

**(A) Recommended: JupyterLab**

In your terminal (with your environment activated):

```bash
jupyter lab
```

- This will open a new tab in your browser.
- Navigate to the notebooks folder.
- Start with `1_data_preparation.ipynb` and proceed step by step.  
  **TODO:** Add screenshot of browser interface and notebooks folder!

**(B) Classic Notebook (if you prefer):**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

- Works exactly the same way.  
  **TODO:** Add screenshot or note where this command is run: always in the terminal!

---

## 📚 Step 5: Follow the Tutorials

- The notebooks are numbered—go through them in order for best results.
- Each notebook includes:
  - Explanations: What you are about to do, and why
  - Code cells: With detailed comments
  - Instructions: What to change, where to add your data, what to expect

**Tip:**
- Jupyter notebooks are organized into “cells”.
- You run one cell at a time by clicking the cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`.
- Cells must be run in order from the top:  
  Make sure all previous cells have been run before running a new one, or you may get errors!
- **TODO:** Add screenshot of notebook with cells, and highlight the Run button

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

- If you run into issues:
  - Check the Issues tab on GitHub, or open a new issue with your question.  
    **TODO:** Provide screenshot of creating a GitHub issue
- Common errors:
  - See the Notes section in our book chapter for the most common pitfalls and solutions.
- **Still stuck?**  
  If you don’t find an answer in the Notes section or we haven’t responded on GitHub, you can also use large language models (like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot). Just paste your error message and the code you’re struggling with—often, these tools can help you quickly find a solution to common mistakes.
